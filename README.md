### My Oh1omon studios' shop consists out of less than 10 thousand lines of code, including FE and BE. It is a convenience-oriented solution, with an attractive and responsive design. MERN stack is used as the basis and Redux with TailwindCSS are improving the application, making it easily scalable and understandable. The client part is deployed to Netlify and API calls go to Heroku deployed rest server. The app is making both client and businessman hookup much easier, and right now I am going to show how.
